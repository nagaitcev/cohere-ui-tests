## Scenario 1: Basic Interaction

### Login via the UI

- Navigate to the login page.
- Perform login using provided credentials.
- Verify successful login by checking for elements that confirm access (e.g., dashboard or profile information).

### Send text via the chat UI

- Interact with the chat interface.
- Send a prompt and verify that the UI displays a response (though the exact content may vary, a very simple check is sufficient).
- Validate that no UI errors occur and the response is rendered appropriately.

### Logout via the UI

- Click the logout button.
- Ensure the user is redirected to the login page or receives confirmation of a successful logout.

## Scenario 2: File Interaction

### Login via the UI

- Repeat the login step from Scenario 1, or write the code in a manner where you can re-use the same authenticated session for multiple tests.

### Upload a file via the UI

- Locate and interact with the file upload component (e.g., a "Browse" button or drag-and-drop feature).
- Upload a text or image file.
- Send a prompt asking the AI to describe the contents of the file.
- Verify that a response is displayed in the UI and ensure the platform handles the interaction without errors.

### Logout via the UI

- Again consider writing the code where you would reuse the session for multiple testcases.Scenario 1: Basic Interaction
